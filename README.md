speech recognition system

## DESCRIPTION
This Jupyter (Google Colab) notebook is designed to convert spoken audio into written text using Pythonâ€™s speech_recognition library. It integrates audio processing and speech-to-text conversion, enabling users to transcribe audio files automatically with a focus on simplicity and effectiveness. The notebook follows a clear, step-by-step structure that includes installing necessary packages, processing an audio file, and printing the resulting transcript.
The first step involves installing two Python libraries: ffmpeg-python and pydub. These packages are required to handle and manipulate audio data. ffmpeg-python acts as a wrapper around the FFmpeg command-line tool, which allows reading and writing of audio/video files in different formats. pydub is used to manipulate audio, though in this particular notebook, it's installed but not directly used. The installation commands ensure that the necessary dependencies are ready for the transcription process.
